About
======

One of the main on-line hangouts for Clojure people is the 
[Clojurians Slack community](http://clojurians.net).

Unfortunately it suffers from its popularity. Slack will only retain the last 10,000 messages of history,  
that is less than two weeks of logs. A lot of valuable information is in that chat history.  
The Clojureverse team has decided to set up this service so that the logs arenâ€™t lost in time.

If some channel is not logging, it's probably because @logbot isn't receiving its messages.  
Feel free to invite @logbot to a channel to start logging.

The source code is in

github repo, you are welcome to contribute.
